    "I would advise caution. It is important to measure uncertianty and account for risk. Small sytemiatic polling errors can make a big difference. Having a large volume of polling data does not eliminate uncertianty, though it does redice sampling error and adds in a mix of reasonable methodologies. However, polls tend to replicate one another's mistakes and hard to reach people may be missed by many polls. FiveThirtyEight uses the accuracy of past polls to help accound for uncertianty. "
